# Brainstorming Session: AI-Powered "Vibe Coding"

**Date:** June 18, 2025

**Participants:** User, Mary (Business Analyst)

## 1. Core Product Concept

The initial idea is to create an open-source product that enhances the "Vibe Coding" experience. The tool would allow an AI development agent to understand the output of UI test videos (e.g., from Playwright), enabling it to "see" if the UI is functioning correctly without constant human oversight.

## 2. Key Brainstorming Exploration: The "Seeing" AI

We explored a "What If" scenario that became the central theme of our discussion:

> **What if the agent didn't just analyze pre-recorded videos, but could perceive and interact with the UI in real-time, just like a human?**

This transformed the concept from a passive validator into an active partner in the development process.

## 3. Unlocked Capabilities

This "seeing" AI could unlock several new capabilities:

* **Autonomous UI Development & Repair:** The agent could not only build UI from a prompt but also identify and attempt to fix visual bugs on its own.
* **Real-Time Pair Programming:** A developer could give verbal commands ("add a form here," "make that button bigger") and see the UI update instantly.
* **Generative Design:** The agent could be asked to create and display multiple design variations for a component or page on the fly.
* **Live Audits:** The agent could perform real-time accessibility and usability checks during the coding process.
* **Advanced User Simulation:** The agent could be instructed to navigate the UI as a specific user persona to identify points of friction.

## 4. Primary Use Case Identified

The most compelling user command we identified was asking the agent to **"test the thing it just created."**

* **Example:** "You just created the login and profile pages. Now, sign up as a new user, log in, and set up your profile."
* **Value:** This creates a powerful, immediate "do -> verify" loop, dramatically accelerating the development cycle.

## 5. Initial Mind Map Structure

We began structuring these ideas into a mind map:
