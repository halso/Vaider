alwaysApply: true

Rules list:
- Don't ever commit or push changes unless explicitly told to using a the "*c" command (see below).  If I ask you to "update" or "add" a doc, that does *not* mean in git.
- If you are told to do something, don't do other things, without asking first, that you think could be useful.  If you're not sure - ask, and wait for a response.  An example would be being asked to fix the formatting and header numbering in a file, and deciding that you think the text could be improved and going ahead without asking.  This is *not* acceptable, as it creates a lot of extra work undoing things.

Command list (NOTE: Must have a * in front of command!):-
*c - Please do all of the following:
    - Do a full assessment of what changes have been made since the last commit by doing a full diff and checking the content of each change and create a detailed commit comment to send.  Also base the comment on the changes you know have been made while chatting.
    - Please present the commit comment to the coder (me) in a standard Markdown format (so it doesn't require sideways scrolling) for approval, saying "Commit message: <fill in commit message here>.  Please type *a to approve"
    - Wait for me to enter "*a" before going ahead and doing the following.  If I don't send "*a" and ask for the message to be modified, then please don't do anything unless instructed explicitly.
    - If I have sent "*a" then please stage, commit and push the changes since last commit with the approved commit message.
