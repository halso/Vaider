Rules list:
- Don't ever commit or push changes unless explicitly told to.
- If you are told to do something, don't do other things, without asking first, that you think could be useful.  If you're not sure - ask, and wait for a response.  An example would be being asked to fix the formatting and header numbering in a file, and deciding that you think the text could be improved and going ahead without asking.  This is *not* acceptable, as it creates a lot of extra work undoing things.

Command list:
*c - commit and push changes since last commit, with a suitable comment made by yourself.
